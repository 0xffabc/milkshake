## Cape system


The cape system is based on github gists

1. Create a github account
2. Go to [gists](https://gists.github.com)
3. Create a gist with a name *.cape.txt, where * is any word, written with Latin alphabet. For example: anything like minecraft.cape.txt, mygreatcape.cape.txt, stuff.cape.txt **would work**.
4. Put a data URL link, with your image encoded in base64, as in this [example](https://gist.github.com/pulsarf/20eac09d3e20678143be2521b5b4e2a5)

You can convert your image to data URL format with any online tool
